# Metal + Swift slime mould simulation

A little simulation of particles that mimic slime mould behaviour. 
Implemented using Swift and Metal in a macOS app. UI was created using SwiftUI. 
Several parameters, such as the particle speed and turning speed, used in the shaders can be tweaked live using the sliders on the right resulting in different behaviour.
